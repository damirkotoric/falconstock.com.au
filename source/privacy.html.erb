    <h1>Falcon Stock's Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Section 1: What do we do with your information?</h2>
    <p>When you purchase the Geelong aerial footage pack (coming in September 2016), we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address. We do this to make it easier to get in touch with you if need be, and to send you a tax invoice of the purchase.</p>

    <h2>Section 2: Consent</h2>
    <p><strong>How do you get my consent?</strong></p>
    <p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
    <p><strong>How do I withdraw my consent?</strong></p>
    <p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at damirkotoric@gmail.com</p>

    <p>Payment is processed by PayPal. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our product to you and take care of keeping your payment secure.</p>
    <h2>Section 5: Third-party Services</h2>
    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
    <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
    <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
    <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
    <p>As an example, if you are located in Australia and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
    <p>Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
